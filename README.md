# Wireless 6 Column Choc Corne Case

This case is modeled for the smaller choc-spaced PCB from Typeractive. It includes both solid and cutout covers for the display, providing flexibility based on your preferences. Additionally, I've included **tenting legs attached with magnets** for added comfort and flexibility.

## Features

- **Sturdy design** with thicker walls
- Just thin enough for a standard USB-C connector to still fit through the wall
- **Very low profile** for a sleek look
- Tight tolerances for a clean and polished build
- Insets for screws on the bottom allow using the case without rubber feet if desired
- **Two cover options**: Solid or cutout for the display
- **Magnetic tenting legs** for ergonomic positioning
- **STL and Shapr3D files provided** for easy customization

## Firmware

The firmware configuration for this case is available in my repository:  
**[Corne ZMK Firmware Configuration](https://github.com/jakmaz/corne-zmk)**.

This includes the keymap and settings optimized for a wireless Corne keyboard build using ZMK.

## STL and Shapr3D Files

To make this case customizable, I’ve included both the **STL files** for 3D printing and the **Shapr3D files** if you want to edit the parts yourself.
