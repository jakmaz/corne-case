## What You Need

### Printed Parts

- **Plates:** [Download here](../case)
- **Cases:** [Download here](../case)
- **Covers:** [Solid](../case/cover-solid.stl) | [Cutout](../case/cover-cutout.stl)
- **Tenting Legs:** [Download here](../case/tenting-leg.stl)

**Printing Tips:**

- I printed everything in PLA with a 0.4mm nozzle at a 0.2mm layer height.
- To achieve a flawless print, I reduced the maximum material flow to 8mmÂ³/s.
- For a weightier feel and better sound, I made the prints solid.
- If printing the covers with your own profile, use ironing for a perfect surface finish.

   - Attach the tenting legs using the built-in magnets for ergonomic positioning.

4. **Attach the PCB to the Case**

   - Drop the assembled PCBs into the cases onto the standoffs, making sure the switches align with the side cutouts.

5. **Secure the Plates**

   - Use the remaining screws to secure the plates to the case standoffs.

6. **Add Rubber Feet**

   - Glue some rubber feet to the bottom of the case for stability.
