## What You Need

### Printed Parts

- **Plates:** [Download here](../plates)
- **Cases:** [Download here](../cases)
- **Covers:** [Solid](../covers/solid) | [Cutout](../covers/cutout)
- **Tenting Legs:** [Download here](../tenting-legs)

**Printing Tips:**

- I printed everything in PLA with a 0.4mm nozzle at a 0.2mm layer height.
- To achieve a flawless print, I reduced the maximum material flow to 8mmÂ³/s.
- For a weightier feel and better sound, I made the prints solid.
- If printing the covers with your own profile, use ironing for a perfect surface finish.
